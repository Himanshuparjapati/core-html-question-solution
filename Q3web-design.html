        <h1>information about Web-design</h1>
        <p>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website
            in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web
            designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web
            designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that
            the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks
            visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.</p>
        <h2>diff between Web-design and Web-development</h2>

        usability elements
        Work directly with a client to create designs or work as part of a team to develop client vision
        May need knowledge of a programming language or some coding skills, or at least some level of familiarity with
        widely used languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript

        Create or implement designs demanded by a client or created by a design team
        Need expert-level knowledge of a variety of programming languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language),
        CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries
