                The accesskey global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current
                element.
                The attribute value must consist of a single printable character
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>autocapitalize:</h1>
                The autocapitalize global attribute is an enumerated attribute that controls whether and how text input
                is
                automatically capitalized as it is entered/edited by the user.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>autofocus:</h1>
                The autofocus global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that an element should be focused on
                page
                load, or when the <dialog> that it is part of is displayed.

        <li><u>
                <h1>class:</h1>
                The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element.
                Classes
                allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions
                like
                the DOM method
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>contenteditable:</h1>
                The contenteditable global attribute is an enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be
                editable
                by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>data-*:</h1>
                The data-* global attributes form a class of attributes called custom data attributes, that allow
                proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation by scripts.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>dir:</h1>
                The dir global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates the directionality of the element's

        <li><u>
                <h1>draggable:</h1>
                The draggable global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates whether the element can be
                dragged,
                either with native browser behavior or the HTML Drag and Drop API.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>

                <h1>exportparts:</h1>
                The exportparts global attribute allows you to select and style elements existing in nested shadow
                trees, by
                exporting their part names.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>hidden:</h1>
                The hidden global attribute is an enumerated attribute indicating that the browser should not render the
                contents of the element. For example, it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used
                until
                the login process has been completed.
        </li></u>
        <li><u>
                <h1>
                    id:
                </h1>
                The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its
                purpose
                is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).
        </li></u>
        <li>
            <u>
                <h1>
                    inert:</h1>
                The inert global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that the browser will ignore the element.
                With the inert attribute, all of the element's flat tree descendants (such as modal <dialog>s) that
                    don't otherwise escape inertness are ignored. The inert attribute also makes the browser ignore
                    input events sent by the user, including focus-related events and events from assistive
                    technologies.
            </u>
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>
                <h1>inputmode:</h1>
                The inputmode global attribute is an enumerated attribute that hints at the type of data that might be
                entered by the user while editing the element or its contents. This allows a browser to display an
                appropriate virtual keyboard.
            </u>
        </li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>is:</h1>
                The is global attribute allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a defined
                custom built-in element (see Using custom elements for more details).

        <li><u>
                <h1>itemprop:</h1>
                The itemprop global attribute is used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element can have an
                itemprop attribute specified, and an itemprop consists of a name-value pair. Each name-value pair is
                called a property, and a group of one or more properties forms an item. Property values are either a
                string or a URL and can be associated with a very wide range of elements including audio, embed,
                iframe, img
                link, object,
                source,
                track, and video.

        <li><u>
                <h1>itemref:</h1>
                Properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope attribute can be associated with an
                item using the global attribute itemref.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>itemscope:</h1>
                itemscope is a boolean global attribute that defines the scope of associated metadata. Specifying the
                itemscope attribute for an element creates a new item, which results in a number of name-value pairs
                that are associated with the element.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>itemtype:</h1>
                The global attribute itemtype specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's
                (item properties) in the data structure.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>lang:</h1>
                The lang global attribute helps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable
                elements are written in, or the language that the editable elements should be written in by the user.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>nonce:</h1>
                The nonce global attribute is a content attribute defining a cryptographic nonce ("number used once")
                which can be used by Content Security Policy to determine whether or not a given fetch will be allowed
                to proceed for a given element.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>part:</h1>
                The part global attribute contains a space-separated list of the part names of the element. Part names
                allows CSS to select and style specific elements in a shadow tree via the ::part pseudo-element.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>popover:</h1>
                The popover global attribute is used to designate an element as a popover element.

        <li><u>
                <h1>slot:</h1>
                The slot global attribute assigns a slot in a shadow DOM shadow tree to an element: An element with a
                slot attribute is assigned to the slot created by the <slot> element whose name attribute's value
                    matches that slot attribute's value.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>spellcheck:</h1>
                The spellcheck global attribute is an enumerated attribute that defines whether the element may be
                checked for spelling errors.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>style:</h1>
                The style global attribute contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it
                is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the style
                element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling,
                for example for testing purposes.
            </u></li>

        <li><u>
                <h1>tabindex:</h1>
                The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them
                from
                being sequentially focusable (usually with the Tab key, hence the name) and determine their relative
                ordering for sequential focus navigation.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>title:</h1>
                The title global attribute contains text representing advisory information related to the element it

        <li><u>
                <h1>translate:</h1>
                The translate global attribute is an enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's
                translatable attribute values and its Text node children should be translated when the page is
                localized, or
                whether to leave them unchanged.
            </u></li>
        <li><u>
                <h1>virtualkeyboardpolicy:</h1>
                <strong>Experimental: This is an experimental technology
                    Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.
                </strong><br>
                The virtualkeyboardpolicy global attribute is an enumerated attribute. When specified on an element that
                also uses the contenteditable attribute, it controls the on-screen virtual keyboard behavior on devices
                such
                as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available.
